# KCNA

The Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) certification provides a beginner friendly option to learn about the Kubernetes community and vast cloud native ecosystem of projects. It is intended for developers and non-developers alike that work in the cloud native ecosystem.

This certification will provide an onramp for an individual to get situated in the wider cloud native and CNCF community and help them prepare for future certifications such as CKA/CKAD/CKS and so on.
