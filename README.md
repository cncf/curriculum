This is the the latest version of the curriculum for the following CNCF exams:

* Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
* Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
* Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)

If you see any errors with the document, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/issues/new) here. The document major and minor version (e.g., the 1 and 8 in 1.8.0) match the version of Kubernetes. The patch version (e.g., the 0 in 1.8.0) represents any iterations in the documentation for that version of Kubernetes. [Old versions](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum/tree/master/old-versions) remain available.

CNCF encourages training companies to align their offerings to cover the contents of the curriculum. Training [partners](https://www.cncf.io/certification/training/) can purchase coupons for the CKA exam at a wholesale price to offer at the end of their training.
